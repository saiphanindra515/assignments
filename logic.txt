and gives all the information about that particular episode as output.

sol)from the question inputs are - season number and episode number
i took inputs using window.prompt and stored in SeasonNumber and episodeNumber.

at every iteration i checked seasonnumber and episodeNumber matching or not using if statement.when if statements holds true i used console.log to print that object.

Q)Write a function that can take any number of episode ids as input and
returns all the information about those episodes.

sol)from the question inputs are - any number of episode ids..
As we dont know the count of inputs i used while loop.
inside loop i used window.prompt to take input.
after  entering every input, i pushed it into array using push() method.
loop ends when user clicks on cancel.(on clicking cancel , prompt window it returns null)
using Rest values are passed.using spread values are stored in function.
i used for loop to iterate over episodes array of objects,at every iteration i compared the ids and when id matches, i printed that object using console.log()
